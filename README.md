# Creditor

## Overview

Creditor is a web application designed to simplify the management of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in your Kubernetes cluster. It automatically detects the CRDs in your cluster and generates a web form for each one. This allows you to create and manage your CRDs in a user-friendly way, without the need to constantly refer to the documentation.

## Features

- **Automatic CRD Detection**: Creditor automatically identifies the CRDs present in your k8s cluster.
- **Dynamic Web Form Generation**: For each detected CRD, Creditor generates a web form. This form provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating and managing instances of the CRD.
- **Documentation-Free Management**: With Creditor, there's no need to constantly refer to the CRD documentation. The web forms provide all the information you need to manage your CRDs.
